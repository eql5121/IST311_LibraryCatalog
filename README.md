# PROJECT INSTRUCTIONS:
Design a Library catalog. Create a catalog that contains various books.
Allow the users to search for books and show their status (availability). 
If available, allow the user to check the book out.
Add more features to your application.

# PRODUCT BACKLOG ITEMS ("USER STORIES")	
1) As a developer, I want classes for objects such as book, catalog, and user, so I can add fields and methods to build the foundations of the library system.	

2) As a user, I want to know different kinds of information about each book (such as the ISBN, title, author, genre, and number of copies available), so that it is easier for me to find what I need.	

3) As a user, I want to know when Iâ€™ve entered invalid information while searching for a book, so I can have a chance to enter correct information.		

4) As a developer, I want to have a Helper class with methods that deal with different types of input, so I can deal with situations when users enter incorrect data/data types while searching for books.

5) As a user, I want to be able to search for a book based on specific criteria (i.e. title, author, genre), so I don't have to look through the whole catalog.														

6) As a user, I want to be able to sort the list of books alphabetically according to a specific attribute (i.e. title, author, genre), so it is easier for me to find what I need.						

7) As a user, I want to be able to check out a book, so that I can read it.	

8) As a developer, I want to save the project as a Javadoc, so I can have a usable and structured HTML representation of my project to display.														

9)As a developer, I want to include proper Javadoc comments for all class methods, so that my code looks as professional as possible.														
10) As a developer, I want to sort classes into packages if need be, so my project is more organized.	

11) As a developer, I want classes for Menu and MenuChoice objects, so I can easily build, modify, and display menus for use in the program.														
12) As a user, I want a UML diagram for the program, so I can better understand how the classes interact with each other.														
13) As a user, I want a main class in the program, so I can run it.
